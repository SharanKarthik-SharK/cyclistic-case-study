## Introduction

In this case study, I perform real-world data analysis as a junior analyst at Cyclistic, a fictional Chicago bike-share company. Cyclistic, a bike-share program in Chicago, seeks to convert more casual riders into annual members to secure sustainable growth. The marketing director believes increasing annual memberships will drive long-term profitability. This case study analyzes internal ride data to identify the behavioral and usage patterns that differentiate annual members from casual riders, supporting data-driven marketing recommendations and I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.
